# Markdown Previewer

A web application that allows you to write and preview markdown code. It is built with React, JavaScript, and CSS/HTML. It's the [third project](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-libraries/front-end-libraries-projects/build-a-drum-machine) for the front end libraries certification (freecodecamp.org).

I've taken some liberties from the original brief. Also, it's halloween inspired as today is 31st of October.
